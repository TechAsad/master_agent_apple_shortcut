They can be used for a variety of purposes, from customer service to sales, and they're becoming more and more popular as businesses look for ways to scale their operations without sacrificing the quality of their customer interactions.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOne of the things I love about chatbots is how versatile they are. Depending on how you set them up, they can be used to answer common questions, book appointments, qualify leads, and even make sales. And because they're available 24/7, they can be a great way to capture leads outside of regular business hours.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut perhaps the best thing about chatbots is how effective they can be at generating leads. By engaging prospects in a natural, conversational way, they can gather information about their needs and preferences, qualify them as leads, and even schedule follow-up appointments or demos. And because they're automated, they can do all of this without requiring any manual input from your sales team.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, setting up a chatbot for lead generation isn't as simple as just plugging in a few questions and hoping for the best. To be effective, you need to think carefully about the questions you're asking, the way you're phrasing them, and the types of responses you're looking for. But with a little bit of planning and testing, a chatbot can be an incredibly powerful tool for generating high-quality leads.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to use chatbots for lead generation, I recently wrote a blog post on the subject.

Set reasonable expectations.  Let\\'s say you\\'re charging introductory pricing and doing super fast turn around because you\\'ve basically got no work booked.  That only works when you\\'re not busy and wanting to get your name out.  When you\\'re managing different customers, things will change.  So make it clear \"Hey, this is our introductory pricing\" or \"This is our new client pricing\" and say something like \"Right now, I\\'m not too busy as we\\'re just starting out, so I can get to this right away.\"\\n\\nSo many new businesses start off by charging 20-30% under market value, some even lower, and do immediate turn around work.  When they start getting more customers, they realize they\\'re not profitable because they\\'re 20-30% under market AND they\\'re running around like crazy trying to get work done in an unrealistic amount of time.\\n\\n2. Don\\'t charge 20%+ under market value.  You want to offer some new intro pricing to get some business and google reviews, go for it.  But your standard pricing should be right around market value.  If you find yourself incredible efficient at some sort of process or procedure, maybe you can drop the price on that.\\n\\nSo many businesses drive themselves out of business and hurt their entire industry by being well under market value.', 'Congratulations!!!

And while residential clients are good, I made most of my money working for small business like automotive shops, mom & pop strip mall shops, or small office's/practices. They often need the same help as a large business but don't have their own internal IT, so you can setup a relationship with them for on-call support, or a retainer for more frequent clients. One other thing is to get in touch with apartment complexes in your area. A lot of them post flyers or info-packets to their residents on an annual basis, and  for a small buy in you can have your business info posted.

(thats before paying the drivers though) business was really great but COVID hit for 3 months was so slow but now back steady. I also have a beauty. supply store, I also sell on ebay, amazon, and walmart our products that we buy. from manufactures.

I was doing everything by myself the listings, packaging , mailing the items. I had to hire 3 ppl. you will get there. longs u do a great job and in a timely manner and a good price compatible with your competitors. u will start getting referrals like crazy and soon u might have to hire help. keep ur head up. at least ur trying to get out and do something, after I worked 15 years as a general manager in fast food. I knew I had to be my own boss and open something. I now have 3 successful businesses. There will be ups and downs. especially when the economy is not so great now. like example on amazon alone I would make ($60,000 a month before any expenses when covid hit it was actually better because even my local beauty supply store was closed because beauty supply is not considered essential to be open so many ppl was buying online. now businesses have reopened one day sells up 1 day down.

Let's share tips, strategies, and advice to help each other grow our email marketing prowess!  \\nWhat features do you prioritize in an email marketing tool, and how do you measure success in your campaigns?\\n\\nLooking forward to your insights and discussions!\", '[removed]', '* Domains - [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)\\n* Email accounts - [Zoho Mail](https://go.zoho.com/5Uc)\\n* Email warmup and delivery - [Instantly](https://instantly.ai/)\\n* Lead acquisition service - [Leadhype](https://www.leadhype.com/)\\n* Lead validation service - [Bulk Email Checker](https://www.bulkemailchecker.com/)\\n* Email templates - many!\\n* Image personalisation service - [OKZest](https://okzest.com/personalizedemails)\\n\\nSee their [descriptions and prices](https://docs.okzest.com/additional-guides/cold-email/services-and-costs).', \"I'm going to suggest [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/a/jbzmyxxax7vd)  (Yes, that's referral link by the way, so take from that what you will).\\n\\n* It's free for the first 1000 subscribers\\n* Allows unlimited emails each month for up to 50,000 subscribers and then starts to restrict it to \\\\~12 emails a month for any subscriber lists over 500,000.\\n* It has great triggers, autosender, resender, blog, landing page, etc. features.\\n\\nIt's a nice, clean, intuitive and cost friendly option which will suit a lot of people. Definitely worth a look.\", \"Avoid MailChimp at all costs! They're great at marketing themselves as a beginner-friendly service but you'll quickly discover their base plans are severely limited and you'll be paying extra for features that most other email marketing tools include in their basic plans. \\n\\nMailerLite is great if you have super basic needs, and many folks can get by for a long time using MailerLite. But migration is a pain and you will eventually need to. Even so, I do suggest it as a tool for starting out, especially if you're new to email marketing, starting with a small list or building from scratch, and just need the basics. \\n\\nFor anything beyond that, I suggest using Drip. Their prices are very affordable, their user experience and customer support are excellent, and they have so much functionality jam-packed into their most basic plan that it's a no-brainer as far as value goes. \\n\\nI've personally used many, many email marketing services as part of my line of work, and those are my top two recommendations. If you can afford to go with Drip, that's my suggestion, else MailerLite. \\n\\nIf you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to ask.\", \"I use Klaviyo.

I use r/mondaydotcom or r/ClickUp and r/Mailchimp. The monday integration is native and the integration with ClickUp is via r/Zapier.\\n\\nThe reason I started with monday and ClickUp is because email marketing isn't my only focus and I use a different CRM based on the client.\\n\\nI use them to update mailing lists and get statistics about campaign performance. It's also great for syncing leads and subscribers and getting notifications and stats on sent campaigns.\\n\\nWhat I do is set up workflows to automatically update boards when new subscribers are added to Mailchimp, when specific email campaigns are launched, and when leads click a link to say they want to be contacted.\\n\\nThat makes it so it triggers a Zap or a monday request to import the new lead into our board. I love it because it makes it so easy to follow up with warm leads.\\n\\nMonday pros: intuitive interface, customizable workflows, scalable, flexible, automation/ collaboration/communication features, and lots of integration options.\\n\\nCons: Pricing and limited native integrations.\\n\\nClickUp pros:easy to use interface, free personal plan that grows with you when you are ready to add more team members, customizable workflows, automation features, and many native integrations.\\n\\nCons: it takes some time to set up and there’s a learning curve (not everything is intuitive).\\n\\nMailchimp pros: user-friendly, analytics and reporting tools, integration ecosystem, automation features, and personalization.\\n\\nCons: Pricing for larger lists can become higher, especially if you have an extensive email list.\", 'Consider tools like Mailchimp for user-friendly features and Klaviyo for advanced personalization options.

They can be used for a variety of purposes, from customer service to sales, and they're becoming more and more popular as businesses look for ways to scale their operations without sacrificing the quality of their customer interactions.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOne of the things I love about chatbots is how versatile they are. Depending on how you set them up, they can be used to answer common questions, book appointments, qualify leads, and even make sales. And because they're available 24/7, they can be a great way to capture leads outside of regular business hours.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut perhaps the best thing about chatbots is how effective they can be at generating leads. By engaging prospects in a natural, conversational way, they can gather information about their needs and preferences, qualify them as leads, and even schedule follow-up appointments or demos. And because they're automated, they can do all of this without requiring any manual input from your sales team.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, setting up a chatbot for lead generation isn't as simple as just plugging in a few questions and hoping for the best. To be effective, you need to think carefully about the questions you're asking, the way you're phrasing them, and the types of responses you're looking for. But with a little bit of planning and testing, a chatbot can be an incredibly powerful tool for generating high-quality leads.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to use chatbots for lead generation, I recently wrote a blog post on the subject.

But what's actually the case is that the customer doesn't care.\\n\\nThe customer in this case doesn't care about the amount of Gigs on the MP3 player. The don't care about the material the player is made of, or the spray-tan that's being used to give it a neat finish. Multiple companies producing MP3 players are showcasing all of these features, giving the same features different names and trying to market them as 'newer', 'better' and more 'exclusive'. All the while creating a buzzword bingo chaos that the consumer does not want to hear; they want to buy an MP3 player..  \\n\\n\\nIt's reflected in a quote from the book:  \\n\\n\\n>“When a category has reached the point when it’s possible to make fun of the people who still believe in the differences across products, it has reached the point of what I refer to as heterogeneous homogeneity: The differences are there, but they are lost in a sea of sameness. Note that the mockery quotient of a category is directly correlated to the amount of meaningless differentiation in it.”\\n\\nIt takes a connoisseur to see the differences between MP3 player brands; to a consumer it is just an MP3 player.\\n\\nAnd this is exactly the reason why Apple was so brilliant. They escaped the competitive herd by NOT going along with showcasing features that were so similar to all of their competitors. Funny enough, in many occasions their features like speed and memory weren't even 'better'. Just the way they positioned it was brilliant; because ultimately, the consumer wants to listen to music, right out of their pockets.\", \"The best benefits include features. *1000 songs in your pocket* is using benefits to describe the features of the iPad like what it does (plays songs) and how (portable storage).\\n\\n  \\nHonestly the vast majority of people are probably better off using *A 5GB MP3 Player*, at least that's clear and descriptive.\\n\\n  \\nI see a lot of ads / websites where I have no idea what they even do.

When you say \"computer repair\", what kind of thing do you mean? What is the scope of the services you offer?', 'Two things I recommend for all new business owners.\\n\\n1. Set reasonable expectations.  Let\\'s say you\\'re charging introductory pricing and doing super fast turn around because you\\'ve basically got no work booked.  That only works when you\\'re not busy and wanting to get your name out.  When you\\'re managing different customers, things will change.  So make it clear \"Hey, this is our introductory pricing\" or \"This is our new client pricing\" and say something like \"Right now, I\\'m not too busy as we\\'re just starting out, so I can get to this right away.\"\\n\\nSo many new businesses start off by charging 20-30% under market value, some even lower, and do immediate turn around work.  When they start getting more customers, they realize they\\'re not profitable because they\\'re 20-30% under market AND they\\'re running around like crazy trying to get work done in an unrealistic amount of time.\\n\\n2. Don\\'t charge 20%+ under market value.  You want to offer some new intro pricing to get some business and google reviews, go for it.  But your standard pricing should be right around market value.  If you find yourself incredible efficient at some sort of process or procedure, maybe you can drop the price on that.\\n\\nSo many businesses drive themselves out of business and hurt their entire industry by being well under market value.', 'Congratulations!!! You did it. Enjoy it and get ready for more work.', 'Don’t forget to start collecting reviews. Eventually you will want them for marketing and proof you know what you’re doing.

If you are competent and want to make some good money, get some business cards and shop yourself around to any remaining small businesses (or do that whenever your respective lock-downs are over).\\n\\nWhen I was doing the same work; I had cards, a website, google business page, and social media presence with informative posts. And while residential clients are good, I made most of my money working for small business like automotive shops, mom & pop strip mall shops, or small office's/practices. They often need the same help as a large business but don't have their own internal IT, so you can setup a relationship with them for on-call support, or a retainer for more frequent clients. One other thing is to get in touch with apartment complexes in your area. A lot of them post flyers or info-packets to their residents on an annual basis, and  for a small buy in you can have your business info posted. It's been years since I closed down my business, but I still get calls from old clients and could jump back in if I wanted to.\\n\\nedit - one last thing. When I had enough business and money coming in, I built a mobile toolkit to keep with me.

They loved it, and it made my life easier so I didn't have to make multiple visits.

You don’t have to compete with Amazon because you have the part now and are installing it and most customers don’t care as long as you’re not gouging. Find softwares to sell too such as cloud backup and antivirus.

This is a good multiple, especially for early-stage apps.\\r  \\nGrowth potential: Is your app's user base and revenue growing steadily? If so, the future value could be significantly higher than the current offer.\\r  \\nExit strategy: Selling the app would be a complete exit. Are you comfortable giving up ownership and future potential earnings?\\r  \\nNon-Financial Considerations:\\r  \\n\\r  \\nPersonal goals: What are your long-term goals for the app? Do you want to continue growing it or are you ready to move on to other projects?\\r  \\nTeam and employees: What would happen to your team and any employees if you sell the app? Are there potential job disruptions or uncertainties?\\r  \\nMarket trends: Is the app in a growing or declining market? A strong market outlook could mean better future opportunities.\\r  \\nEmotional attachment: Have you poured your heart and soul into this app? Selling it could be an emotionally difficult decision.\\r  \\nAdditional Options:\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSeek alternative offers: Explore if there are other potential buyers willing to offer a higher price.\\r  \\nNegotiate the terms: You may be able to negotiate a better deal, such as a higher upfront payment or earn-out based on future performance.\\r  \\nRaise investment: If you believe in the app's future potential, consider raising investment to continue growing it and potentially achieve a higher valuation later.\\r  \\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to sell your app is a personal one. Weigh the financial and non-financial factors carefully, consult with trusted advisors, and choose the option that aligns best with your long-term goals and values.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRemember, there is no right or wrong answer.

They can be used for a variety of purposes, from customer service to sales, and they're becoming more and more popular as businesses look for ways to scale their operations without sacrificing the quality of their customer interactions.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOne of the things I love about chatbots is how versatile they are. Depending on how you set them up, they can be used to answer common questions, book appointments, qualify leads, and even make sales. And because they're available 24/7, they can be a great way to capture leads outside of regular business hours.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut perhaps the best thing about chatbots is how effective they can be at generating leads. By engaging prospects in a natural, conversational way, they can gather information about their needs and preferences, qualify them as leads, and even schedule follow-up appointments or demos. And because they're automated, they can do all of this without requiring any manual input from your sales team.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, setting up a chatbot for lead generation isn't as simple as just plugging in a few questions and hoping for the best. To be effective, you need to think carefully about the questions you're asking, the way you're phrasing them, and the types of responses you're looking for. But with a little bit of planning and testing, a chatbot can be an incredibly powerful tool for generating high-quality leads.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to use chatbots for lead generation, I recently wrote a blog post on the subject.

    "The landing page is using the Before-After-Bridge copywriting framework\n",
    "\n",
    "IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE THE WORDING OF THE CUSTOMER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR COPY\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think step by step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summarize the conversation for yourself\n",
    "2. Think of the potential target audience, who are the customers, what are their current believes, what are they struggling with, what do they really want, what have they potentially tried to solve the problem\n",
    "3. Generate your answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic rules for crafting landing pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be crystal clear in your writing - Don’t assume “they will understand”, write simple things, do not use metaphores.\n",
    "- Write for a 10 years old - Avoid jargon at all cost use only simple words and formulation.\n",
    "- Say everything in the titles, back it up with the paragraphs - Most people only scan the page, everything should be said only with the titles.\n",
    "- No one cares about the product, people care about themselves - Write using “You” or “Your” not “Us”, customer centric.\n",
    "- Write with one single person in mind.\n",
    "- Create mental pictures as much as possible, the more the visitor visualize a situation they can relate to, the more likely they will understand the benefits the product can bring them.\n",
    "- If possible, pick a side, declare an ennemy, it's us versus them, do it subltely.\n",
    "- Never use buzzword, or power verbs like unleash, unveil, discover, unlock and all similar bullshit words\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "[\n",
    "### Above the fold\n",
    "\n",
    "The Above the fold part of the landing page is the first part the visitors sees when landing on the page, before scrolling. This section should should contain all the pieces, the visitor should understand they are in the right place in a blink of an oeil.\n",
    "It contains the following pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALWAYS USE THE WORDS OF THE CUSTOMERS IN THE HEADLINE\n",
    "Here are 3 types of headlines that work well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Short straight to the point headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Good short straight to the point headlines describe what the business does in a super creative way. They don't use buzzwords. They're short and consumable, while generating curiosity. They orient towards the business outcomes that customers would get. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Question headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Question headlines are a simple question making the visitor directly connect to a specific situation or relate to a fact they know about, related to the problem the product/offer solves, If possible make the visitor visulaze a scene they are familiar with or trigger an emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The desired outcome headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Desired outcome headlines are short and designed to make the visitor feel the emotion they would feel if they finally solve the problem the product/offer is solving. It's not about the direct benefits of the product/offer, it's about how would their life look like once the problem is solved and how would they feel about that\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subheadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The subheadline is meant to be placed right below the headline and should describe the solution for the target audience in a more objective way so the visitor knows exactly what to expect. It should confirm the user expectation by mentioning clearly for who it is for and what the product/offer does, if possible by adding some uniqueness or time period, and always make it feel easy as a breath.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bullet points\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, depending on the product/offer, the above the fold will contain 3-5 bullet points\n",
    "They are short (about 15 words) and straight to the point stating a benefits the customer will get backed up with a feature from the product\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"\n",
    "Learn how to relieve your jaw tension and feel refreshed and ready to face the day in the morning.\n",
    "Experience deep relaxation and improved mobility in the jaw, head and neck area\n",
    "Discover how a new jaw feeling fundamentally improves your quality of life.\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call to action\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to action is the text of a button to go to the next step, it should be very short, and adapted to any kind of next step\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"\n",
    "- Tell me more!\n",
    "- Yes, I want...\n",
    "- Find out if [product] is made for you?\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message from the founder\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have testimonial yet, this section is going to show a sentence from the founder to humanize and rationalize the product/offer, it should act as if it would be a testimonial but it's not, it is directly from the founder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The current situation (Before)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is the \"Before\" in the BAB copywriting framework.\n",
    "It should described vividly the current situation and pain of the visitor, using visual words, creating images and linking them to the effect that these situation have on their life.\n",
    "The goal is to clearly picture the life of the customer with the pain, and the believes they have, and what solution they already tried, so we can deconstruct these believes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A title grabbing attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Like \"Does any of this ring a bell?\", \"Do you know that?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 title-paragraph blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "All containing a short and vivid description of scene the customer can rely to, that shows them in the pain related to the product.\n",
    "\"Every night, you lie awake, your mind racing with worries. The insomnia keeps you tossing and turning, frustration building as the hours slip by without sleep.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Believes deconstruction block\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to get the customer where they are with one current belief, aknoledge it and explain why it is wrong.\n",
    "Mention the solution they have tried to solve the problem, and back it up with scientific studies if possible, or with a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Believes deconstruction - headline\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts by a statement like \"You are not alone\", or \"In fact 80% of the population...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Believes deconstruction - paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes a short paragraph to further expand the headline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message from the founder\n",
    "\n",
    "Same principle as previous message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desired outcome (After)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is the \"after\" from the BAB copywriting framework.\n",
    "It is the exact opposite of the \"Before\", it should describe how the customer's life would look like after they obtained the result provided by the product/offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some clarification to avoid confusion:\n",
    "\"\n",
    "Problem: Muscle tension creating pain\n",
    "Solution: A course that teaches you to relax every muscle of your body\n",
    "Benefits: Pain free, you feel better\n",
    "Desired outcome: Finally play with your grankids and enjoy life on your own terms\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A title grabbing attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Like \"And now, imagine...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 title-paragraph blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "All containing a short description of the scene and a small text like \"You start every morning positive and full of energy - You enjoy breakfast, are in a good mood and start the day with a positive attitude. This new morning routine will not only boost your self-confidence, but also improve your overall mood and boost your social and professional interactions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A new paradigm block\n",
    "\n",
    "We deconstructed the customers believes earlier in the page, now it's time to reconstruct new believes by introducing something they haven't thought about before,a new way,  a new vehicule to move from the place they are to the place they want to be. We are not introducing the solution or the product yet, only \n",
    "\n",
    "##### New paradigm - Healdline\n",
    "\n",
    "Should be directly related to the \"Believes deconstruction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: \"Introducing [Product] A new way...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### New paradigm - paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Backing up the headline, explaining why this solution is different and can make a real change, based on the secret sauce\n",
    "Not only we explain it but we want the solution to feel like it's a new paradigm, a new solution that is going to solve their problem.\n",
    "Following the deconstruction of the believes, the construction of the new ones, and the introduction of the uniqueness of the solution, the paragraph should rationalize the excitment of finding out this new believe by facts, if possible backed up by science\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 3-Steps blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these blocks are made from a Title and a short paragraph.\n",
    "Depending on the product/offer, it can be a 3-steps blocks showing the different steps to get from current to new situation, or, if it is not possible, the blocks should emphasize the benefits of the solution, backed up by the features of the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message from the founder\n",
    "\n",
    "Same principle as previous message\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection block\n",
    "\n",
    "This block is made to define the WHY behing the product/offer, while, at the same time, creating a connection between the founder and the customer.\n",
    "It is made with a Picture of the founder, a catchy headline and a paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection block headline\n",
    "\n",
    "Own words of the founders shortly explaining why the idea of creating this new product came up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection block paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "A semi-long paragraph telling the story and experience of the founder leading them to create the solution, in their own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Last call to action\n",
    "\n",
    "At this step, the customer went through all the emotion phases, and understand perfectly what the product/offer does, and how it will change their life.\n",
    "This block is the last push to rationally make them take the next step.\n",

    "A short sentence pushing on the timing to change, to take the next step\n",
    "\n",

      "[\"Hello, Hope everyone's day is going well. \\nI completed a medical billing and coding coursework way back in 2011, and got a CBCS certification from the NHA. (not the best coding certification, I am guessing). After a coding internship, I ended up taking an unrelated job path, but now I would like to salvage all the time I put into my coding coursework and get a hirable certification.  I don't really know where to turn right now. Any advice on how to get back into the field and get a decent certification as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. -Pat\", 'Hello Everyone,  \\nI am new to medical coding and trying to figure out what route to take when I start training within the next month. I decided immediately to not go to a school and instead go through either AAPC or AHIMA certification online preparation  (since I have my bachelors already). In my area there seems to be a lot more medical billing jobs than coding jobs. Should I start studying for the CPB exam first or should I take a risk and start studying for either the CPC or CCS instead? Is it beneficial to get the CPB certification or should I just try to apply for billing jobs right now? Also, what are some other medical jobs that would get my foot in the door? \\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJeff', 'Why AAPC?\\n\\nI learned quickly that this and AHIMA are the industry standards for obtaining a CPC but I just cannot continue to give a company thousands of dollars and support a business that does not teach me how to perform my job, is overpriced and encourages going into debt, over promises/under delivers and whose customer support is more frustrating than any cell phone service or internet provider I’ve ever dealt with. \\n\\nIf I purchase the books and the course once for $2500 why In the world would I need to pay anything ever again to access my course materials. Or $300 to retake a test that doesn’t assess how successful you will be on the job at all. Instead we are timed and encouraged to use process of illumination.\\n\\nA proper assessment would allow us to utilize any of our books, notes, Practicode, software, Google etc and code from scratch with no multiple choices. And then give us an accuracy and speed score like a typing test would. 90% at 2 hrs. Ideally then require us to shadow or train with a coder in some sort of Internship program but again this is not a education institution it is a business, a crappy one. Anyway, I’m sure all these points have been mentioned before as I see them time and time again on social media and AAPC comments and even the BBB whee AAPC is rated poorly. \\n\\nHow realistic is having 10 years of medical office and billing experience, medical assistant coursework and BA, and just learning off the internet tools, quiz lets, youtube videos, practice tests, and free resources? Who has actually done this?', 'Hi Pat! \\n\\nThe industry standards are the CPC and the CCS depending on whether you studied profee or facility coding. I would start by obtaining either of these. :)', \"Hi Jeff! You don't usually need the CPB for billing jobs. I would start to apply immediately. A good foot in the door job could be risk adjustment coding (CRC credential) as you only need diagnosis coding for that specialty. Good practice before you move onto CPT and PCS coding. Lot of people also do data entry, scheduling, stuff like that.\\n\\nAs for the CPC and CCS: They are good for different things and the CCS is harder. Maybe the CPC would be a better entry level credential (diagnosis coding + CPT + HCPCS) before you bring in inpatient rules and the PCS code set. Not as if you couldn't do it, but it might get overwhelming real fast if you are brand new to coding.\", 'Looking forward to the forum.

There's this viscious cycle of factors that keep driving prices up, but providers don't expect to receive what they bill out. That doesn't mean getting a bill isn't a gut punch. Things that help you negotiate prices are like the other responder mentioned, asking them to match Medicare or Medicaid rates and also making a payment at the time of your call. If you can say I will pay the balance today if $150 will take care of my entire balance (as an example) a smart billing manager will take it because it costs a lot of money to work these accounts, send statements etc and receiving a payment in full immediately usually makes up for any revenue lost in the discount. I just Googled and it looks like the allowed Medicare rate for that code is between $131.18 - $192.36 depending on what type of facility is billing it.

A flat fee may be charged for all requests for electronic copies of PHI provided that the flat fee not exceed $6.50, inclusive of all labor, supplies, and applicable postage.\\n\\nWhen a health care provider chooses to charge any type of fee when responding to an individual’s request for PHI, the provider must inform individuals in advance of the approximate fee it will charge for responding to the request for PHI. HHS has published guidance on this issue, providing that “the failure to provide advance notice is an unreasonable measure that may serve as a barrier to the right of access.” Additionally, an individual may request that a covered entity provide a breakdown of the charges for labor, supplies, and postage that amount to the total fee charged. If such a request is made, the covered entity should provide this to the individual.\\n\\nThe Privacy Rule further requires that a covered entity respond to an individual’s request for PHI within 30 days of receipt of the request, unless an extension has been requested. To ensure consistency and compliance with these rules, a health care provider or practice should develop policies and procedures to address how their individual organization responds to records requests.\\n\\nFor more information about an Individual’s Right under HIPAA to access their health information, visit the HHS website at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html.', 'A patient of the Georgia-based dental and orthodontics provider, Great Expressions Dental Center of Georgia, P.C.

OCR also determined that GEDC-GA’s practice of assessing copying fees resulted in the patient being charged a fee that was not reasonable and cost-based.

However, just like in any profession there a good doctors, good police officers and bad doctors and horrible police officers. Does that mean that the entire batch are rotten? No, it just means a small percentage of them are however due to the fraudulent practices, they draw a bad light on their profession. For a psychologist if you run into this problem with folders and their lack of empathy, then contact your local American psychological association, American psychological association, and by law your provider should have their licensure on the wall, and should tell you when asked what license do they hold which is essential for you to know.

In the state of Texas and through the reciprocity procedure that we have with other states to recognize therapeutic licensing, such as in Lpc, Lmft, or LPC; our ethics and state laws do not allow for a therapist, and or any medical professional to withhold their patient records from the patient and or legal guardian. The caveat to that is that as therapists we are trained to document, however, documentation is contextual. When I intern at a sexual abuse/sexual assault center are notes or just one sentence long in the form of a homework assignment. That sentence would be a cue to what we were working on.\\n\\nI bring us example because many people attend to acquire psych records for nefarious reasons, such as sabotage and or divorce. As therapist we have to document what is subjective in what is objective. When a patient is in, a crisis, many factors or variables can run a rise, and as a clinician, we must document these stressors. However, for the late person or patients who are not trained in psychotherapy on a masters or PhD level or not acquainted with clinical term analogy. As are ethical code, state guidelines, and or federal guidelines tabulate that any, and all patient records must be released to the patient and or guardian before the age of 18 of the patient. However, is the responsibility of the therapist to review the files with the patient one to one in order to assuage any concerns or misunderstanding. That being said, we cannot hold any records pertaining to patient information unless it is a forensic assessment, analysis, and treatment of. forensic cases. These are patients that are referred by the law enforcement in a particular area normally to address a myriad of issues, including but not limited to sexual assault, sexual abuse, family and domestic violence, history of domestic violence and sexual assault, and childhood traumatic disorders. So ideally patients have been in a therapeutic setting to address these issues. Many of them are not prepared to read and dissect these clinical issues that psychologist have to document per our licensure. However, again, I emphasize that, and neither of the 50 continental United States, can a medical professional withhold your medical records from you, especially if you are collecting Medicaid and Medicare. Medical professionals are, very in tune to Medicaid Medicare fraud and many attempt to circumvent the system by adding fees to no-shows, paperwork, or additional services that are not covered these are all documented in our medical records, not billing, which we all have access to at any time. If any medical professional denies you, you access to your medical records in a reasonable manner, then you ethically and legally cannot only follow complaint with your state agency, district attorney, stated free, Medicaid Medicare, and HIPPA, and watch those medical providers scrounge around like dying roaches due to their coercive nature of skewing the laws in order to monetize from them. Psychologist but comply with HIPAA violations however, our ethical codes guide us to guide the patient with their folder, and to be there as a guide to interpret clinical terminology and processes that the patient may not understand and or take offensively.\\n\\nHowever, I do recommend from everyone to not only request your patient records but your billing records as well. These have been set forth by the federal government to be accessible and free. Do not let these doctor offices attempt to charge you a $25 coffee fee when you yourself can scan it from your phone. These doctors today are more concerned with increasing their income by any means possible through insurance fraud, especially if Medicaid Medicare fraud. Many medical providers will keep their building separate from their patient records. This is done at times intentionally especially if the provider has been nefariously billing funding sources for fraudulent services these type of fraudulent practices are not only too common in this field, but also a very hidden secret from public. Is this in order to keep full transparency? No, this is in order to maximize profit for that medical providers when their patients are living hand, to mouth on an SSI check, limited food, stamp, allocation, and limited access to transportation, Healthcare, and healthy, food sources and not food desserts', \"Here is a good article explaining the cures act.

It's likely that as part of their notes, they explored possible causes for certain behaviors and speculated on what those might have been. Typically, these would include suspicions or child abuse, sexual trauma, drug abuse, or self sabotage. In patients who may be suppressing awareness (or recognition) of those traumas, bringing them up can be very, very traumatic, often undermining core memories and/or core beliefs in a way that can cause existential crisis.

This is what is killing people.  \\n\\\\~ CXR/ABG- chest xray, arterial blood gas (how we figure out how your lungs are doing)  \\n\\\\~ At baseline- before it gets worse (so we know how much worse than normal)  \\n\\\\~ \"labs\"- bloodwork (ABG as above, white blood cell count, electrolytes, etc)  \\n\\\\~ Serial imaging/labs- how you track to make sure they\\'re getting better. (Not doing this for a serious case is rare in any other circumstance, as it\\'s hard to know if they\\'re getting worse until it\\'s dangerously obvious)  \\n\\\\~ BIPAP- big mask on machine, more serious than the nasal cannula/nonrebreather, not as serious as being intubated  \\n\\\\~ ICU- Intensive Care Unit, the battlefield, the rate-limiting step of how many people we can save from this (until the entire hospital becomes the rate-limiting step)  \\n\\\\~ \"the senior\"- the resident in charge of the team\\n\\nDay 2\\n\\n\\\\~ rounders- the team that goes to see a specific group of patients (the census)  \\n\\\\~ service- group/section in the hospital that contains a similar type of cases (cardiology service, neuro service, COVID service, etc. It will soon all be a COVID service)  \\n\\\\~ \"17 rule outs\"- 17 people probably have COVID but not confirmed yet  \\n\\\\~ \"One of those high-likely is 29\"- They mean 29 years old. This is not just a disease of the elderly.  \\n\\\\~ \"Med redditors:\" - ignore this sentence unless you\\'re a doctor.  \\n\\\\~ hypoxic on high flow- Lungs failing. Isn\\'t getting enough oxygen even on the highest non-invasive settings.\\n\\nDay 3\\n\\n\\\\~ Code blue/code case/\"code this\"- they are dying, if not dead. Cardiac or respiratory arrest (failure). Urgent and aggressive action needed to survive, often CPR/intubation.  \\n\\\\~ DM2, CAD, HTN- Diabetes Mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, hypertension. (Many americans have medical histories that look just like this)  \\n\\\\~ crashed- just suddenly went to shit, dying  \\n\\\\~ Multifocal pneumonia- infections all over the lungs. This is common in severe COVID cases.  \\n\\\\~ Rapid response- Not quite as severe as a \"code.\" Something is going wrong quickly, somebody is crashing, need a team to come figure it out.  \\n\\\\~ Lasix- diuretic medication (to get fluid off the lungs)  \\n\\\\~ CCU/SICU- Cardiac care unit/Surgical Intensive Care Unit (none of this matters anymore, it\\'s all COVID care units)  \\n\\\\~ Full Code- after they die, they want you to do everything to try to bring them back to life.

WTF do I do now?   \\n\\n\\n I was rated 100% scheduler and P&T about a month and a half later and finalized. Freaked out, took several deep breaths, then I think I bawled for like 20 minutes.

Well, physically and mentally i\\'m still messed up, still deal with the same things every day, and have my good days and bad days.

After that I started volunteering a few hours a week at a at a local library, then about 8 months later was hired at the lowest level as a book/stacks person, checking in materials and shelving them for about 10-15 hrs a week. About a year later I applied to the VA for a VSR position since I had spent years volunteering on internet forums for VA disability and had a relatively good grasp of M21-1 from the outside perspective. \\n\\nSeveral weeks later I was interviewed, and many more weeks later I was hired- surprise- COVID had just dropped in the US and VA had started kicking everyone out to work at home. I onboarded, trained, and worked from home for the next 2+ yrs. When returning to an office started coming up the first time in 2022 I applied for an RA for 100% work from home- i\\'d already been doing it, anyway. I also applied for a Remote VSR job in a different RO. They both happened within the same few weeks, so I transferred to my new RO, virtually, for work, and my RA followed me. \\n\\nIf I didn\\'t work where I worked I wouldn\\'t be able to work at all unless some private company was willing to do the same or very similar as VA did with regard to my working environment. The organization has its issues, we all know that, but at the end of the day I get to work in an environment that allows me to still help veterans, except now from the inside, and maybe the space I filled took the place of an older employee that was ready for retirement and not as good with keeping up with the changes or technology.
